XStream is a popular Java library used for converting Java objects to XML and transforming XML data back into Java objects.

XML Transformation: XStream is used to convert Java objects into XML data (serialization) and transform XML data into Java objects (deserialization). This provides a method for Java applications to transfer data between different systems or components.

Simple Usage: XStream makes it very simple to convert Java objects to XML or transform XML data into Java objects. Users can serialize objects to XML or deserialize XML to objects with just a single line of code.

Annotation Support: XStream can automatically serialize Java classes without requiring developers to add custom XML tags. This is beneficial for developers who prefer using Java classes directly for XML transformation. Additionally, it allows customization of the XML output by using custom tags or aliases.

Various Output Formats: XStream has the capability to transform XML data into different output formats, such as text-based (String), file output, or JSON.

Extensibility: XStream provides customization options, such as adding user-defined transformation rules for specific conversion tasks.

Mapping with Java Objects: XStream can be used to map between Java objects and XML, enabling the use of Java objects when handling XML data and vice versa, transforming Java objects into XML data.

Full Document Support: XStream can handle XML data as complete documents, making it easy to work with documents that have complex XML structures.

Open Source and Free: XStream is an open-source project and is free to use, meaning it can be integrated into any Java project without licensing costs.
